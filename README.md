# bookcpt
this is custom post type of book it has list of features.

You need to create a plugin which will:
1. Create a custom post type - Books
2. Create 2 custom taxonomies - Authors & Publishers
3. Add a custom meta box - Book Price
4. A shortcode that will produce a search template where I can search for books based on the following parameters
    4.1 Book title
    4.2 Price range
    4.3 Author selection
    4.4 Publisher selection
    4.5 The results should be sortable based on the book title and price.
    4.6 The user can “load more” the search results.

While developing the plugin, make sure of the following:

1. You create custom post types and taxonomies by code and DO NOT use any kind of plugin.
2. For the sorting feature in the search template, make sure you DO NOT use a jQuery library like Datatables. You need to write custom code for everything that is asked.
3. Make sure that you follow the WordPress coding standards.

Once you develop the plugin, you can push the plugin to your GitHub account and email us the link.


for shortcode of search page use this [search] or use /book url both are same.
